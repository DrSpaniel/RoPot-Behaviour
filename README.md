# RoPot Behaviour
 behaviour code for final project 'RoPot'.

 this final project is a robot pot which notifies the plant owner (user) when to water the plant. it contains a custom made PCB, a bunch of LED thingies, a speaker, motors, and a capacative soil sensor. and the encloser is fully modeled, and 3d printed by me! (ingredients will be added soon) this was made using arduino! thanks arduino.
